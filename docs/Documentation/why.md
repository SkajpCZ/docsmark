# Why docsmark was created?

Its simple, all of the other markdown documentation webpages were kinda shit, everything complicated, bloated and much much more. Because of that I realized that I have keyboard and display, so why not create my own right? The goal is simple and easy - create something that I can put markdown files into and it will create a nice webpage from them, some support for images and bunch of little things. 

I am not saying that this project is perfect, its just what suits me and if I want I can change every bit of it in couple of minutes.

# Insipiration

- I used [Hugo with Lotus docs](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/lotusdocs/) but it was mess. Testing was nightmare and setting it up was too. I designed it in kinda the same way, you can take a look here.
